He has a powerful new ally: Catherine Gouriou, a formidable assassin who wants to kill Mosley (because he doesn't know his irregular verbs correctly). When Tommy first meets Catherine, he is quoted as saying, "I guess assassins can be picky about their targets, Mosley's irregular verbs must have really bothered you."</p>

            <p><br>Tommy's plan works, but he is seriously injured in the final confrontation. Lizzy dies soon after and Tommy must deal with grief while recovering from his injuries.</p>
            <br><br><h2>Episode 6: It's the End</h2>
            <p><br>Tommy Shelby faces his inner demons and decides to sacrifice himself to prevent Mosley from gaining power.

            <br><br><h2>Episode 7: The Mask</h2>
            <p><br>1 year after episode 6... Since Tommy's death, a mysterious character has appeared: The Mask. He wears a white porcelain mask that completely covers his face, hiding his identity. He is an expert in espionage, infiltration and sabotage... He works in the shadows, leaving no trace behind him. No one knows who he really is or where he comes from, but it is said that he is a former Peaky Blinders and that he is very intelligent. His hands are burned, as if he had escaped... from an explosion for example...</p>
